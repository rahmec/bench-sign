# MQOM v2

The repository contains the implementation of the *MQOM-v2* digital signature scheme proposed by the MQOM team. See the [MQOM website](https://mqom.org/) for details. 

## Dependencies

* To build: `Makefile`
* To use the helper `manage.py`: Python3 (version >= 3.6)

## Quick Usage

The `manage.py` Python script aims to ease the use of the MQOM source code. To compile one or several schemes, you can use

```bash
python3 manage.py compile [schemes ...]
```

where `[schemes ...]` is a non-empty list including all the existing MQOM instances with the format `<category>_<base-field>_<trade-off>_<variant>`:
 * `<category>` can be `cat1`, `cat3` or `cat5`;
 * `<base-field>` can be `gf2` or `gf256`;
 * `<trade-off>` can be `short` or `fast`;
 * `<variant>` can be `r3` or `r5`.

You can also use prefixes to select a set of instances. For example, `cat3` refers to all the instances of Category III, `cat1_gf256` refers to all the instances of Category I with GF(256) as base field and `cat5_gf2_short` refers to all the instances of Category V with GF(2) as base field targeting short communication.

Some optimizations (for Rjindael, Keccak, ...) can be selected using environment variable, see Section "Advanced Usage"

## Advanced Usage

To compile a specific instance of a scheme with `Makefile` file, you need to set the preprocessing variables in the compilation toolchain:
 * `MQOM2_PARAM_SECURITY` is the security level in bits, it may be `128` (for Cat I), `192` (for Cat III) and `256` (for Cat V);
 * `MQOM2_PARAM_BASE_FIELD` is the (log2 of the order of) base field, it may be `1` for the field GF(2) and `8` for the field GF(256);
 * `MQOM2_PARAM_TRADEOFF` is the trade-off, it may be `1` for the trade-off "short" and `0` for the trade-off "fast".
 * `MQOM2_PARAM_NBROUNDS` is the variant, it may be `3r` for the sigma variant and `5r` for the 5-round variant.
Those variables will select the file of the desired parameter set in `parameters/`. You can set them using the `EXTRA_CFLAGS` environment variable. You can get the `EXTRA_CFLAGS` that corresponds to a specific instance using the command
```bash
python3 manage.py env <scheme>
```
where `<scheme>` is an existing instance (in the format `<category>_<base-field>_<trade-off>_<variant>`).

Moreover, you can set environment variable to compile some optimizations:
 * *Rjindael implementation*: `RJINDAEL_TABLE=1` selects a table-based optimized (non-constant time) implementation, while `RIJNDAEL_AES_NI=1` selects a constant-time implementation optimized using the AES-NI instruction set. By default, it uses the portable Rijndael bitslice implementation (adapted from [BearSSL](https://bearssl.org/constanttime.html)), a bit slower than the table-based one (but constant time), corresponding to `RIJNDAEL_BITSLICE=1`. Another implementation is also available using `RIJNDAEL_CONSTANT_TIME_REF=1`: it is here mostly for a readable reference constant time implementation, but it is very slow and hence should be avoided.
 * *Field implementation*: `FIELDS_REF=1` selects a reference constant-time implementation, `FIELD_AVX2=1` selects an optimized implementation using AVX2 instruction set and `FIELD_GFNI=1` selects an optimized implementation using GFNI instruction set. By default, it select the faster implementation for the current platform.
 * *Keccak implementation*: `KECCAK_AVX2=1` select a Keccak implementation optimized using the AVX2 instruction set. By default, it uses a 64-bit optimized implementation.
 * *XOF*: `USE_XOF_X4=1` (this is the default) activates the usage of x4 XOF implementations, while `USE_XOF_X4=0` deactivates it.
 * *PRG and PIOP caches*: `USE_PRG_CACHE=1` and `USE_PIOP_CACHE=1` (default when compiling) activate the caches usage for PRG and PIOP, which significantly accelerate the computations at the expense of more memory usage. To save memory, these can be
explicitly deactivated with `USE_PRG_CACHE=0` and `USE_PIOP_CACHE=0`.
 * *Memory efficient BLC*: `MEMORY_EFFICIENT_BLC=1` (default is 0, deactivated) activates saving memory for BLC trees computations at the expense of slightly more cycles as these are recomputed.
